<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

When it comes to traveling, sometimes it can be a struggle to plan out where you want to go, especially if you're going somewhere you've never been to before. Our project aims to create a travel planning tool that gives attraction, hotel, and food recommendations to LA tourists, and provides a detailed and personalized travel plan based on users' selections, including attractions to go for each day and a route recommendation.


### Built With

* []()
* [Geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#nominatim)
Geopy is a Python client for geocoding that obtains the longitude/latitude coordinates for an address. We make use of Nominatim from Geopy, which is a geocoder for OpenStreetMap (OSM), an open data map of the world.
* [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.24.0/api/#)
OSRM is a routing engine that uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to generate the shortest routes between locations. By sending a request to OSRM, you obtain a Polyline encoding that contains information such as the route, distance, and duration.
* [Polyline](https://polyline.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1/)
We use the Python implementation of Polyline, which is Google's Encoded Polyline Algorithm Format that stores a series of coordinates as an encoded string.
* [Folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)
We use Folium to visualize route data on an interactive leaflet map. Folium supports Polyline, so it is the best module to use with OSRM.
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/):
We used Flask to develop our webapp for this project. Since it's written in Python, it makes it easier for us to call the scraper and route generator we have created.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jren99/pic16b_project.git
   ```
2. Install packages
   ```sh
   pip install pandas
   pip install Flask
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   pip install geopy
   pip install folium
   pip install polyline

   ```
### Execution
```sh
   cd webapp
   python3 app.py
   ```

<!-- ETHICS -->
## Ethics

Depending on what recommendations Tripadvisor gives us, maybe the sightseeing locations will privilege some cultural sites above others, depending on what races and ethnicities are more prevalent in a location. Also, if weâ€™re recommending sightseeing and hotel locations, Tripadvisor might favor larger and more popular sites rather than smaller sites. As popularity is largely based on positive reviews, it's hardly objective since there are many bogus positive reviews.

<!-- LIMITATIONS -->
## Limitations

* Because of the inefficiency of scraper, we were only able to obtain a dataset for LA instead of California or even larger range. Hence, our webapp is limited to users who want to plan a trip to LA. However, we believe a more efficient scraping method can potentially extend the functionality of our app to larger area.
* Generating the most optimal travel plan such that the user can choose some arbitrary number of attractions and days to stay in LA would be a very difficult problem. To determine the distance/duration of each possible route, we would have to send multiple requests to OSRM, which would be time-consuming and inefficient. We could also treat this as a Traveling Salesman type of problem, but it's unrealistic to construct such a route that passes through all the attractions and find nearby hotels for each of them. We think it makes more sense to have one hotel that the user stays in and use it as the starting point for each day's route. It might also be realistic to add an option for two hotels as well, though our implementation currently does not support this.

## Acknowledgements

* [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/):Since our project aims to provide a list of hotels, attractions, and restaurants recommendations, we need reliable and latest data sets. Hence, we accessed the information above from TripAdvisor.
* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright): OSM provides all of the map data we use to generate the routes and create the route visualizations. We are very thankful that such an amazing service is open-source!
